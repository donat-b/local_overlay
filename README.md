#### app-misc/task-spooler
task spooler is a Unix batch system where the tasks spooled run one after the
other. The amount of jobs to run at once can be set at any time. Each user in
each system has his own job queue. The tasks are run in the correct context
(that of enqueue) from any shell/process, and its output/results can be easily
watched. It is very useful when you know that your commands depend on a lot of
RAM, a lot of disk use, give a lot of output, or for whatever reason it's
better not to run them all at the same time, while you want to keep your
resources busy for maximum benefit.

#### app-text/base91 [0.6.0]
basE91 is an advanced method for encoding binary data as ASCII characters. It
is similar to UUencode or base64, but is more efficient. The overhead produced
by basE91 depends on the input data. It amounts at most to 23% (versus 33% for
base64) and can range down to 14%, which typically occurs on 0-byte blocks.

#### media-gfx/guetzli [1.0.1]
Guetzli is a JPEG encoder that aims for excellent compression density at high visual quality. Guetzli-generated images are typically 20-30% smaller than images of equivalent quality generated by libjpeg. Guetzli generates only sequential (nonprogressive) JPEGs due to faster decompression speeds they offer.</longdescription>

#### net-mail/trysterobiff
Trysterobiff is a cross-plattform non-polling IMAP new-mail systray notifier.
Instead of polling it uses the IDLE extension of IMAP. With the IDLE extension
an IMAP server immediately sends mailbox status updates to the client. Using
this mechanism you really get notified of new mail as fast as possible.
