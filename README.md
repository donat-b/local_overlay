#### net-mail/trysterobiff
Trysterobiff is a cross-plattform non-polling IMAP new-mail systray notifier.
Instead of polling it uses the IDLE extension of IMAP. With the IDLE extension
an IMAP server immediately sends mailbox status updates to the client. Using
this mechanism you really get notified of new mail as fast as possible.


#### sys-fs/btfs [2.6]
Mount any .torrent file or magnet link and then use it as any read-only directory in your file tree.
